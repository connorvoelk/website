            <h2>Problem Space</h2>
            <p>In this time period, more and more people are depending on rideshare services
              like Lyft and Uber as a means of transportation. These new rideshare services bring a
              plethora of safety problems not only for the passengers but also for the drivers. The
              drivers often have to be in difficult situations where their safety is in jeopardy. Most
              ride-sharing drivers are exposed to many types of passengers: drunk people,
              aggressive people, and rude people. There are some safety features for passengers,
              but not enough for drivers even though their encounters with many different people are
              compounded daily. <br /> <br />
              Specifically, we focused on problems that might arise when the driver has a problem
              with the passenger. For example, what if the passenger is very rude when they get in
              the car, what if the passenger makes the driver uncomfortable, what if the driver
              encounters a drunk passenger. We believed this is the most important problem because
              it could be the most common problem that the driver faces. This specific problem also
              gave us the ability to be more creative with our solutions as opposed</p>

            <img class="proj-big-img" src="assets/ride/timeline.png" alt="Timeline">
            <h2>User Research</h2>
            <h2>Contextual Interviews</h2>
            <p>In the first contextual interview, the focus was on the safety of the rider in the rideshare
              equation. A key observation made was that the perceived safety of both the rider and
              the driver were dependent on each other. All of the safety features that we could see
              were available to the rider. It was unclear what was available to the driver. The driver is
              also in control of the environment of the car, which contributes to the safety and
              comfortability of the driver and rider. <br /> <br />
              The last contextual interview put the driver in focus in order to think about safety from a
              different perspective. An interesting observation was that most of the time, the driver
              had more to lose. If the driver did not want to pick up the passenger because the
              passenger had a low rating, it increased the declining rate for the driver. The higher the
              declining rate the lower the chance of the driver getting a ride that made them the most
              amount of money. This meant that the drivers sometimes have to sacrifice their safety
              for money. This was an important observation because it allowed us to see how the
              driver is often at a disadvantage.</p>
            <h2>Online</h2>
            <p>The Uber Driver subreddit (<a target="_blank"
                href="https://www.reddit.com/r/uberdrivers/">r/uberdrivers</a>) was a great source of rideshare drivers
              voicing their own
              opinions and needs. We witnessed a resentment towards Uber for not taking their
              safety as seriously, as well as many pieces of anecdotal evidence of unsafe situations.</p>
            <h3>Driver Interaction Map</h3>
            <img class="proj-big-img" src="assets/ride/chart.png" alt="User Interaction Map">
            <h2>Ideation</h2>
            <p>After some more user research and ideating over 50 ideas, our group decided on a concept that would allow
              drivers to report riders that exhibited unsafe behavior. With this data, drivers could make decisions like
              if they should that person or not, if a rider were to exibhit very unsafe behavior, then they would be
              banned.
              <br> <br>
              For the low fidelity prototype, we sketched out wireframes, and then uploaded them to Marvel to add
              naviagtion functionality.</p>

              that my team saw using our feature. I was able to send out a link to a Figma prototype and privately chat
              with them to understand their frustrations and successses.</p>

            <h2>Problem Space</h2>
            <p>With COVID-19 prompting us to examine the values held by customers, workers and,
              businesses, consumers have difficulty navigating the limited shopping options available
              especially with local businesses struggling. This paper seeks to understand the values that
              consumers, businesses and workers hold towards sustainability and safety in a pandemic
              economy. By utilizing stakeholder value analyses, value scenarios, and a value oriented coding
              manual, we identified values towards operating business in a sustainable manner during a
              pandemic. The results suggest that there is a balance that can be struck between efficient
              operations and the sustainability and safety of a workplace. If our society and its closely tied
              economy (global and local) are to exit this crisis smoothly and quickly, consumers need to
              understand what they are supporting in their shopping decisions and advocate for safe and
              healthy practices among all aspects of a supply chain.</p>
            <h2>Design Process</h2>
            <p>In our attempt to better understand the effects of consumers shopping during the
              COVID-19 pandemic we began with conceptual investigation to try and better understand the
              web of values and how the behaviors from shoppers, business owners, and workers affect
              those values. We then shifted our focus towards empirical investigation, where we discovered
              criteria that would lead our technical investigation such as “employee safety vs business
              efficiency” and “product cost vs sustainability/ethical practices”. To understand the specifics of the
              design process for this project, our <a target="_blank"
                href="assets/cons/ConnorVoelkConsciousConsumer.pdf">case study</a> goes into greater detail.</p>
            <h2>Proposed Intervention</h2>
            <p>Our technical investiagtion and ideation lead us to belive that a browser extension that activates on an
              Amazon product page in order to find information about the product and sellers supply chain would bring
              the
              information that consumers want to the forefront of their online shopping experienece. </p>

            <h2>Problem Space</h2>
            <p>The after-market for shoes, t-shirts and pretty much everything is bigger than ever right now. Many people attempt to gain access to exclusive and limited items, but few are able to actually accomplish this. Resellers make up a bulk of this group and flip their purchases for profit. There are still some who just try and purchase items in order to keep too. Some third party publications attempt to make release calendars that could fit what they found important, but an issue with this system is that the user has no input of what is important to them., they are at the mercy of the publictation to tell them what they think is important, and seomtimes this may be tainted more by endorsment deals and other objectives. Kno elimiinates concers by storingf all of this information in oner place where only relevant drops are sdtored by user inputted or user shared information.</p>

            <h2>Problem Space</h2>
            <p>I and a team of UW students worked with a data set created by the Center for Disease Control and
              Prevention. This data set includes the crude death rate and age adjusted death rate of the top leading
              causes of death in the United States. Our interactive webpage is intended for individuals who are
              interested in learning about the top leading causes of deaths in the United States, whether it be by year,
              states, or as a nation. We are hoping these individuals have a goal of using this data in order to figure
              out what causes are most important to address in order to decrease death rate due to these causes.

              Through our project, we want to answer these three questions for our audience:
            <ul>
              <li>
                What is the age adjusted death rate for each state for a cause of death in a given year?
              </li>
              <li>
                How do causes of death(on a national scale) change over time?
              </li>
              <li>
                What are the all time leading causes of death in each state?
              </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>Roles</h2>
            <h3>UI Designer</h3>
            <p>I created the entire app UI and organization. I started with a simple wireferame sketch, then found Shiny
              documentation to see what was possible and did the rest in HTML and CSS.</p>
            <h3>Data Analyst & Visualizer</h3>
            <p>Starting with cleaning the data for the entrie team I deleted duplicate rows, simplfied columns to what
              was relevant and compareable for our team and then got to work on creating an interactive map to show the
              geographic distribution and regional trends with causes of death in the United States.</p>

            <p>Difficulties college students run into when deciding what classes to take will almost always revolve around the instructor that is teaching the course.

            <p>Communicated with other teams working on other aspects of design and development for the project as well

            <h3>SQL Engineer</h3>
            <p>Built a database in SQl with tables shown in the ERD, check constraints to match those tables and their applications, (nested )stored procedures to fill each table with error handling to meet constraints and computed columns to help with data analysis that was then importe into Tableau.</p>
